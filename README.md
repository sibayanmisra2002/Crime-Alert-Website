# Crime-Alert-Website
This project aims to provide a deeper understanding of crime in India and to assist police reinforcement by identifying areas with the highest crime rates. By analyzing crime data, police can reposition and station officers more effectively in neighborhoods with elevated crime levels. Additionally, we will develop a Machine Learning Classification model to predict the type of crime based on the day, month, and hour it was reported. Ultimately, we hope this model will help guide police reinforcement by accurately identifying the type of crime they are dealing with, thereby improving response strategies and resource allocation.
