    In 2020, the total number of rape cases reported in India amounted to over 28 thousand. This was a decrease in rape cases compared to the previous year. Even though many rapes are not reported in the country, it is an issue that continuously makes news headlines, some leading to public protests. Although reports of rape have increased in recent years, it was still associated with shame for the victim, rather than the perpetrator.<br><br>A victim of rape in India not only experiences social stigmatization but what is more, her fight for justice is not made easy due to the system that often faults the victim for their misfortune. Instances have been reported where victims are confronted with hostile conditions at police stations and have been often pressured to withdraw their cases. However, once a case goes to trial, it can take decades before anything is resolved. <br> <br> Rape cases in particular, face huge backlog where the number of new cases supersede the number of cases disposed every year. The process is arduous and could add so much trauma to the victimâ€™s life that they often buckle under pressure from family of their own or that of the perpetrator.
