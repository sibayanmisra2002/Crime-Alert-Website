# Crime-Alert-Website
This project was intended to have a deeper understanding of crime in country India, as well as to direct police reinforcement to understand where most crimes occur. As a result, police reinforcement can reposition and station officers accordingly to neighbourhoods where there is a higher crime rate.  In addition, based on the data we will create a Machine Learning Classification model that will predict what type of crime was involved based on the day/month/hour it was reported. Ultimately, we hope this model will navigate and guide police reinforcement on what type of crime they are dealing with.
